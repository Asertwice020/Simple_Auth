To create consistent and branded email templates for your company, I'll need some key information. Here are the essential details I need:

Company Information:

Company name (to replace "Your Company")
Company logo or brand colors (if you have specific ones you'd like to use instead of the current indigo/blue gradient)
Company website URL (for footer links)
Branding Elements:

Primary brand color (currently using indigo/blue gradients)
Secondary brand color
Preferred font family (currently using Segoe UI)
Any specific brand guidelines or style preferences
Contact Information:

Support email address (for security concerns)
Support team name (currently using "The Security Team")
Social media links (if you'd like to include them in the footer)
Legal/Footer Information:

Copyright text
Legal disclaimers (if any)
Privacy policy URL
Terms of service URL
Email-specific Details:

Code expiration time (currently set to 15 minutes for verification)
Password reset link expiration time (currently set to 10 minutes)
Any specific call-to-action button text preferences
Preferred greeting style (currently using "Dear {username}")
Once you provide these details, I can create a cohesive set of email templates that perfectly represent your brand while maintaining the professional yet friendly tone we've established. Would you like to provide any of these details?
